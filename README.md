# Baula Rentals

Baula Rentals is a monolithic real estate web application built using an MVC architecture pattern. The project focuses on backend structure, reusable middleware, and server-side rendering using Pug.

## Architecture

The application follows a traditional MVC pattern:

- Models: Handle database logic and data structure
- Controllers: Manage request handling and business logic
- Views: Rendered using Pug templating
- Middleware: Reusable request validation and authentication logic

This structure helps maintain clear separation of concerns and scalable organization as the project grows.
